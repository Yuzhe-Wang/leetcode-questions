Permutation(nums, n)
generate all permutations of length n

parameters:
1. nums: the given array
2. d: the current depth of the search tree
3. n: the length of the permutations
4. used: an array of bool, labeling whether the number on index i is used or not (alternativly a set). It has the same length with the given array
5. curr: an array to store temperoary answer
6. and: an array of array, the answers

p(nums, d, n, used, curr, ans):
    if d == n:
        ans.append(curr)
        return
    
    for i = 0 to len(nums):
        if used[i]:
            continue
        used[i] = True
        curr.push(nums[i])
        p(nums, d+1, n, used, curr, ans)
        curr.pop()
        used[i] = false

Combination(nums,n)
generate all the combinations of length n

parameters:
1. nums: the given array
2. d: the current depth of the search tree
3. n: the length of the permutations
4. s: the current lower bound for possible answers, this ensure that the number on a certain index will be used only once on a certain layer in the decision tree
5. curr: an array to store the temperoary answer
6. ans: an array of array, the answers

note that we don't need an used array because the for loop is different, in combination, orders doesn't matter

c(nums, d, n, s, curr, ans):
    if d == n:
        ans.append(curr)
        return
    
    for i = s to len(nums):
        curr.push(nums[i])
        c(nums, d + 1, n, i + 1, curr, ans)
        curr.pop()


side note: d is not necessary to be passed around because it can be inferred from te size of curr

some possible variations:
1. leetcode 39, one number can be used for multiple times, recurrsive step: dfs(s=i instead of i+1)
2. leetcode 40, the input may cantains duplicates, sort the input array, and disallow same value on same depth
3. generate combinations according to the length, generate with fixed n value for all possible n values
